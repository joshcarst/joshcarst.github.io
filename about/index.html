          <h4>About me</h4>
          <p>I really like computers and videos. Those have been my two main things since day one. I would never go
            outside as a child (I still don't) - I was running around with the family camcorder when I was four years
            old,
            for Pete's sake. From there, I really took to video editing at around 12, when I started making a bunch of
            dumb little YouTube videos (I still do). I was spending all my time online or playing around with all
            different types of software. My experience grew throughout high school, which is also when I was made aware
            of
            the Motion Picture Science undergraduate program at RIT, which would allow me to pursue all the interests I
            had - as well as fields of science and computing in a similar vein that were new to me - as a career.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="500" data-aos-offset="300" data-aos-easing="ease-in-out-quad"
          class="one-half column" style="margin-top: 10%; text-align:right">
          <p>Since arriving at RIT, my confidence in my choice of major has been solidified. I love all aspects of the
            film industry, and my fascination with the technical side has only increased. My eyes have also been opened
            further to the neighboring field of imaging science which RIT is so renowned for. I was out of commission the
            summer between my freshman and sophomore years due to open heart surgery, but now I'm on a mad quest to find
            opportunities for experience in one of these fields. I'm confident I can use what I've learned to help your
            organization reach whatever end goal it's pursuing. Whatever you're up to, I can find a way to help. I'd
            love
            to do an internship, research, or really anything. Feel free to <a
