          <h4>About me</h4>
          <p>I really like computers and videos. Those have been my two main things since day one. I would never go outside as a child - I was instead obsessed with the family camcorder. From there, I really took to video editing at around 12, when I started making a bunch of dumb little YouTube videos. I was spending all my time online or playing around with different types of editing and effects software, starting with Windows Movie Maker and working my way up to Resolve and Premiere Pro. My experience grew throughout high school, which is also when I was made aware of the Motion Picture Science undergraduate program at RIT, which would allow me to pursue all the interests I had - as well as fields of science and computing in a similar vein that were new to me - as a career.</p>

          <p>Since arriving at RIT, my confidence in my choice of major has been solidified. I love all aspects of the motion picture industry, and my fascination with the technical side has only increased. My eyes have also been opened to virtual production thanks to RIT's budding VP curriculum and partnerships which have already brought me lots of unique experience. I'm confident I can use what I've learned to help your organization reach whatever end goal it's pursuing. Whatever you're up to, I can find a way to help. I'm looking for ambitious companies in the motion picture technology space to start my career off strong with.
